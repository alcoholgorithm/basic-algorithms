# Algorithms

## Summary
Reference code for the algorithms you see on my tiktok videos, written by me, if not, usually cited in the README and file doc (I've made sure they're under FOSS licenses). I've included implementations in a few common languages for accessibility.

## How to use this repo
Feel free to fork the entire repo and run the scripts with the instructions in the code docs. A link to the relevant tiktok content is also included in each Directory's README for reference to the visualizations

## Contributing
Feel free to submit pull requests of simpler/cleaner re-implemetations or implementations in different languages; I'll consult relevant experts as I review them. 
 - to keep new learners from getting confused, *Please ensure the sematics of your implementation match those of the existing ones*.
 - please use your language's *standard linter* before sending a PR to show new learners what clean and idiomatic code looks like
 - throw in helpful comments explaining sematics, as I have done in the existing code
 - the goal of this repo is to make algorithms lessons more accessible, feel free to modify my explainer comments or re-use them, whatever makes your step-by-step  explanations more concise
